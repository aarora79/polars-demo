>Polars: Lightning-fast DataFrame library for Rust and Python

This repository contains a notebook and presentation. The notebook provides code samples for Polars that use the NYC taxi dataset and the Amazon reviews dataset. The presentation contains a high level introduction to Polars including "Why Polars when we had Pandas?" and several useful references for further exploring Polars.

The notebook has been created using Amazon SageMaker Notebooks and tested on the `ml.t3.2xlarge` instances and the `conda_python3` kernel.
